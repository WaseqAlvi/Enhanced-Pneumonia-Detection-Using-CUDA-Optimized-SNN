# Enhanced Pneumonia Detection Using CUDA-Optimized CNNs

This repository contains the implementation of a novel medical image analysis framework designed for fast and accurate pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images. The project leverages CUDA-optimized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to enhance computational capabilities, enabling real-time analysis.

## Features

- **CUDA Optimization**: Utilizes NVIDIA CUDA to accelerate deep learning model training and inference.
- **CNN Architecture**: Custom-designed CNN architecture tailored for pneumonia detection.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Techniques for preparing chest X-ray images for model training.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Comprehensive evaluation metrics and visualizations to assess model performance.
- **Thesis Documentation**: Detailed explanation of the methodology and findings in the included thesis PDF.
